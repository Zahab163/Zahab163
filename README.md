Hi! Iâ€™m Zahabia Ahmed , a methodical and curious developer passionate about turning data into engaging digital experiences. I enjoy blending creativity with technical precision, especially through web-based solutions like Streamlit. This repo is where Iâ€™ll be building and sharing my journey into **Artificial Intelligence**, **Data Science**, and other interactive app-based projects. 

## ðŸ“¦ About This Repository

This is my dedicated space for all **Streamlit** apps and future projects exploring the fields of:
- AI & machine learning
- Data visualization and analytics
- Interactive dashboards
- Web deployment & user-centric design

Whether it's experimenting with models or deploying usable tools, everything here will reflect my learning and growth in tech.

## Coming Soon

Stay tuned for:
- Streamlit Expense Tracker (deployed & shareable)
- AI-driven data explorers
- Visual storytelling dashboards

## ðŸ’¡ Letâ€™s Connect

Iâ€™m actively refining my digital presence and sharing my work across platforms. Feel free to reach out or follow my journey as I grow my developer identity and dive deeper into data-driven innovation.
