# 👋 Hi there, I'm Zahabia Ahmed

Welcome to my GitHub!a methodical and curious developer passionate about turning data into engaging digital experiences. I enjoy blending creativity with technical precision, especially through web-based solutions like Streamlit. This repo is where I’ll be building and sharing my journey into **Artificial Intelligence**, **Data Science**, and other interactive app-based projects.  I’m a developer with a knack for turning ideas into practical, interactive tools. My work blends **creativity**, **code**, and **real-world insight**, whether I'm analyzing traffic patterns or crafting productivity apps. This is where I document my learning journey especially in AI and Data Science.

## 🧠 Python Projects: My Learning Lab

🔎 This repo is a collection of all the projects I’m exploring in my **AI and Data Science coursework**, plus everything I build to dig deeper into the field. It's where theory meets hands-on experimentation.

### 📚 What You’ll Find:
- Machine learning mini-projects and concept walkthroughs  
- Data visualization exercises using Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib  
- Exploratory analysis inspired by real-world datasets  
- Python tools that simulate physics, automate tasks, and analyze trends
-  Streamlit dashboards for interactive exploration  
- API integration experiments and future automation ideas  

I continuously update this space as I complete new modules and develop skills in AI, data handling, and Python logic.
